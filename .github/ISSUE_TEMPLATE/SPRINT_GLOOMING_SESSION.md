## Initiative / goal
Describe how this feature impacts an initiative the business is working on.

### Define the workstream *scope* (10min)

What is the area to work on during the dev days, as a group?
Be as specific as you can, without going to go into details.


A user story should typically have a summary structured this way:

1. **As a** [user concerned by the story]
2. **I want** [goal of the story]
3. **so that** [reason for the story]

The “so that” part is optional if more details are provided in the description.

This can then become “As a user managing my properties, I want notifications when adding or removing images.”


### Collect related issues (15min)

Only issues that *already exist*

You can make notes for issues you think you might need (don´t create them yet on GitHub, just make notes).

### High-level work plan (20min)

Identify the most important work items, in bullet points.
Identify which are crucial dependencies, which are optional.
Estimate how much time the work will roughly take.
Tentatively put names against the work items.

Think carefully about:
* what is realistic to achieve during the dev sprint
* what should go on longer roadmap
* which items are "good first issues", which ones are expert issues

Create a work plan for the week. Prioritize so crucial items are covered.

### Expectations (Acceptance criteria)

Describe and detail how to verify and show that this feature has been satisfied.

### Post break-away discovery (next meeting)

Each individual should research and break down the work item put against their name. 
They should use the Sprint Feature template to define and break down the work items.
Team members are encourage to also research on the work items assigned to their team members.
Post the break-away each individual should present their breakdown (~ 5mins).

Throughout the presentations think carefully and note:
* sub tasks that might be missing from the work item break down 
* over or under estimation of work items
* the dependencies and possible blockers
* possible ways to handle the dependencies
* technical debt - tasks or work items that should go on the roadmap because there is either not enough time or resources
